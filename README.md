# Task-4<br>
## Variables,Expression,Condition and function:<br>
### Variables:<br>
Variables like a container in which we store the data by assign  a value to a name using the( = )operator.<br>
### Expression:<br>
Python have a wide range of operators for creating expressions, including arithmetic(+,-,*,/), comparison(<,==,!=,>), and logical operators(And,OR).<br>
### Condition:<br>
Conditional output in python can be obtained by using if-else and elif (else if) statements.<br>
### function:<br>
A function in python is declared by the keyword ‘def’ before the name of the function.<br>
Functions can return values using the return statement.<br>
## Maximum possible value in integer in python?<br>
In Python, value of an integer is not bounded by the number of bits and can expand to the limit of the available memory.<br>In Python 3, there is only one type “int” for all type of integers.<br>In Python 2.7,there are two separate types “int” (which is 32 bit) and “long int” that is same as “int” of Python 3.<br>
## Global and local variables in python:<br>
### Global variables:<br>
These are those which are defined outside any function and which are accessible throughout the program, i.e.,<br> inside and outside of every function. <br>
### Local variables:<br>
Local variables in Python are those which are initialized inside a function and belong only to that particular function.<br> It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function.<br>
## Packin and unpacking arguments in python:<br>
### Unpacking:<br>
We can use * to unpack the list so that all elements of it can be passed as different parameters.<br>
### Packing: <br>
When we don’t know how many arguments need to be passed to a python function, we can use Packing to pack all arguments in a tuple.<br> 
## Type conversion in python:<br>
Type conversion is a simple process by using this we convert one data type to another data type.<br>
There are two types of type conversion in Python.<br>
### Implicit Conversion - automatic type conversion<br>
Python automatically converts one data type to another. This is known as implicit type conversion.<br>
### Explicit Conversion - manual type conversion<br>
User manually converts one data type to another. This is known as Explicit type conversion.<br>
## Bytes object VS String in python:<br>
### Bytes object:<br>
1)Objects are sequences of bytes.<br>
2)Byte objects are in machine readable form.<br>
3)Byte objects are machine readable, they can be directly stored on the disk.<br>
4)Conversion from bytes to String is known as decoding.<br>
### String:<br>
1)String are sequences of character<br>
2)Strings are only in human readable form.<br>
3)Strings need encoding before which they can be stored on disk.<br>
4)Conversion from string to bytes is known as encoding<br>

## swap variable:<br>
Swap variables mean the values of multiple variables are exchange.In python there is various method to swap the variables.<br>
1.Using temp method<br>
2.Using Arithmetic opretor method<br>
3.Using ^ method<br>
## Private variable:<br>
Private variable means that scope of variables values is within the class.and the values of variables is not accessed outside the class.<br>
In Python, to declare private variables or methods, single or double underscores are used.<br>
In Python, there is no strict concept of "private variables" like you might find in some other programming languages.<br>We can access the private variables outside the class in python by (variable name._class name__private) this concept called the name mangling.<br>
