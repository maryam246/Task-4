## Variables,Expression,Condition and function:
### Variables:
Variables like a container in which we store the data by assign  a value to a name using the( = )operator.
### Expression:
Python have a wide range of operators for creating expressions, including arithmetic(+,-,*,/), comparison(<,==,!=,>), and logical operators(And,OR).
### Condition:
Conditional output in python can be obtained by using if-else and elif (else if) statements. 
### function:
A function in python is declared by the keyword ‘def’ before the name of the function.
Functions can return values using the return statement.
## Maximum possible value in integer in python?
In Python, value of an integer is not bounded by the number of bits and can expand to the limit of the available memory.In Python 3, there is only one type “int” for all type of integers.In Python 2.7,there are two separate types “int” (which is 32 bit) and “long int” that is same as “int” of Python 3.
## Global and local variables in python:
### Global variables:
These are those which are defined outside any function and which are accessible throughout the program, i.e., inside and outside of every function. 
### Local variables:
Local variables in Python are those which are initialized inside a function and belong only to that particular function. It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function.
## Packin and unpacking arguments in python:
### Unpacking:
We can use * to unpack the list so that all elements of it can be passed as different parameters.
### Packing: 
When we don’t know how many arguments need to be passed to a python function, we can use Packing to pack all arguments in a tuple. 
## Type conversion in python:
Type conversion is a simple process by using this we convert one data type to another data type.
There are two types of type conversion in Python.
### Implicit Conversion - automatic type conversion
Python automatically converts one data type to another. This is known as implicit type conversion.
### Explicit Conversion - manual type conversion
User manually converts one data type to another. This is known as Explicit type conversion.
## Bytes object VS String in python:
### Bytes object:
1)t
2)h
3)k
4)k
### String:
1)j
2)i
3)j
4)k

## swap variable:
Swap variables mean the values of multiple variables are exchange.In python there is various method to swap the variables.
1.Using temp method
2.Using Arithmetic opretor method
3.Using ^ method
## Private variable:
Private variable means that scope of variables values is within the class.and the values of variables is not accessed outside the class.
By double underscore we make the variable private.
In Python, there is no strict concept of "private variables" like you might find in some other programming languages.We can access the private variables outside the class in python this concept called the name mangling.
## Name(A special variable)in python:
